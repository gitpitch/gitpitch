## What is GitPitch?

GitPitch is a service that turns **[PITCHME.md](https://gitpitch.com/#gitpitch-pitchme-markdown)** markdown into online and offline, interactive slideshows. You can use it to promote, pitch or present absolutely anything, including your own Git projects.

Each slideshow presentation is made instantly available online just as soon as you git-commit and push **PITCHME.md** on any branch within a public [GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Git-Repo-Services) repo.

GitPitch is an open source project so you can fork, clone, and modify the source. You can find detailed build instructions [here](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Server-Build-Instructions). You can also submit bug, feature and pull-requests on this repo. If you like this project please show your support with a [GitHub star](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/stargazers). Much appreciated.

## Is GitPitch for you?

If you ever find yourself needing to present a concept, design, library, integration, framework, or solution:

- To colleagues, clients or customers
- Or at meetups or conferences

Then GitPitch is for you. Simply capture your ideas in Markdown and let GitPitch automatically turn those ideas into compelling, responsive, online and offline slideshow presentations.

## How does GitPitch work?

No more Keynote. No more PowerPoint. Just Markdown. Then git-commit on any branch within a public GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repo.
